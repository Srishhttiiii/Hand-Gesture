# Hand Gesture Detection
This project is designed to recognize hand gestures in real-time using a computer vision technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The application allows the user to use a computer camera to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
-Python 3.6 or higher

-TensorFlow 2.0 or higher

-OpenCV 4.0 or higher

-NumPy


## Usage
After running the application, hold your hand in front of the camera and make one of the following gestures to perform the corresponding action:

Thumbs up: Increase the volume.

Thumbs down: Decrease the volume.

OK sign: Start the media.

Stop Sign: Stop the media.

Thumb and Pinky: place a call

Yo Sign: play rock song 

Index and Thumb: next song

# Training the Model
## Dataset
The model was trained on the [Hand Gesture Recognition Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog), which consists of 10 different hand gestures performed by 10 different users.

# Conclusion
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks. The application allows the user to perform various actions, such as controlling media playback, by making different hand gestures in front of the camera. The project includes a detailed README file that explains how to install and run the application, as well as how to train the model on a custom dataset. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and computer vision to create intuitive and interactive interfaces for various applications.
